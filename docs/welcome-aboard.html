                            Give wins to the group, accept individual responsibility when things go wrong.

                                Wikipedia</a> for reference. This works both positively and negatively. 
                                The negative form: the longer a task remains undone, the longer it can 
                                be expected to remain undone.

                        <p>There's not enough of it in day to day interactions. I like this quote by 
                            Henry James: 
                            <blockquote>
                                “Three things in human life are important: <br>
                                the first is to be kind; <br>
                                the second is to be kind; <br>
                                and the third is to be kind.”
                            </blockquote>
                        </p>

                <li>
                    <details>
                        <summary>Operate transparently</summary>
                        <p>My default is to be open and trusting of others. If we're negotiating compensation 
                            or working together, I don't want to hold any information back - 
                            I'd prefer to collaborate and have each party 
                            come away feeling better for the interaction. 
                            Plus, it's just <i>easier</i> not to play games 
                            or be sneaky.

            <p>
                I think it is important for people to have access to salary data in order to inform their own decision making. <br>
                This of course does not contain every relevant data point, but it is a starting reference.
